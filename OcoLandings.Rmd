#Octopus Landings data for Mexico

```{r}
Landings<- read.csv("Data/OctoLanding.csv")
summary(Landings)
```

### Clean the data, can we eliminate those columns that we won't need?

```{r Select}
library(dplyr)
Clean<- select(Landings, Year:ONI)
head(Clean)

```

### Filter, how many years presented landings over 15,000 tons?

```{r Filter}
filter(Clean, Total.Landings >= 15000)

#22 years presented more than 15,000 tons
```

### Group, what was the mean catch for El Nino, La Nina and Normal years?
```{r group_by}
Clean %>% group_by(ONI) %>% summarize(M_Pacific_Landings=mean(Pacific.Landings),sd=sd(Pacific.Landings))
